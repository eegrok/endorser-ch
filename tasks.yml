- 95 2 use UUIDs instead of rowids (in case we want to make it impractical to download all claims, even though all the DIDs will be hidden)
- 95 0 show an error, eg. on a confirmation for a claim that doesn't exist
- 95 1 fix IDCommunity links
- 95 1 show signatures for proof of confirmations
- 95 1 the number in the green result might not always be a JWT ID so we should label the entity type (to help with debugging)
  - ... and add confirmation IDs for confirmation claims
- 95 2 fix infura.io "legacy access request rate exceeded" (esp. in tests for ethr-did-resolver)
- 95 2 publish txid of merkle-tree of the transactions (then automate merkle-tree)
  - add test for creating the chain and adding a claim and creating more, ensuring duplicate records get different hashes
- 95 0 and fix subjects (eg. Jun 29 claims by me for others)
- 95 1 allow read of all data in claims/confirmations issued by requester
- 95 1 in text search: show claim contents instead of DB records
- 95 1 in text search: remove any results without text after DIDs are hidden (because that means the matching data was a DID that the user shouldn't see)
- 92 1 fix any endpoints that return arrays to be a {"result":...} object to handle "publicUrls" (eg claim search)
- 92 0 remove the didVisibleToDids when listing possible confirmations
- 92 1 change name of app from "uport demo" (when logging in)

  - allow import of identity
  - get running on Android
  - check if Veramo is working

- 90 0 remove the @context of schema.org for AgreeAction claims since they're already in schema.org
- 90 0 why do some claims (eg. claimIIW2019aFor1) not have iss set?
- 90 0 if we see someone in between 2 hops away, give a URL search for that person to replicate
- 90 0 wrap all async functions (eg. services) in try-catch blocks
- 90 0 don't save in network table if subject is not * or valid DID (eg. avoid HIDDEN)
- 90 1 don't count any confirmations by original claimant in UI reporting
- 90 0 network: remove inserts and add explicit allowance for requester
- 90 0 is issuer used consistently from JWT (and is payload.iss usage accurate?)
- 90 0 rename issuer to issuerDid in confirmation table
- 90 0 retrieveTenureClaimsAndConfirmations & retrieveActionClaimsAndConfirmations should be OUTER JOIN?
- 90 0 document decision on whether original issuerDid adds to count (or should be removed from *_claim tables and built into logic)
- 90 2 add search for claim
  - 90 2 add search for claim on parcel of land
  - ?
- 90 1 fix deploy issues: npm ci & prune (in deploy.sh) and babel (above)
- 90 1 on ReportClaim there's a "*" next to hidden addresses, so explain it
- 85 2 add translation to verifiable credentials: vc, credentialSubject, issuer, issuanceDate https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#credential-subject https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#json-web-token
- 85 0 fix error: user claims & confirmations not showing (currently by non-subject should be by issuer)
- 85 0 remove "subject" from terminology in code; prefer "agent" (Why?) (... or did I change JoinClaim?)
- 85 1 convert all response dates to ISO format (including zone)
- 85 1 look into the action & tenure & role results from "ClaimsAndConfirmations" and make sure the top-level list organization makes sense
- 85 0 deploy from git rather than from local?  (It's all public.)
- 80 6 remove reliance on Infura.io (used to route signing requests, and to validate JWTs)
- 80 0 automate DB backup
- 80 1 debug: add "id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY," to event table and see failures with unhandled promises
- 80 1 report page: who has confirmations for an activity, test various data combinations (eg. action confirmed by self)
- 80 2 export to Neo4J
- 80 5 switch/add format to verifiable credentials?
- 80 5 uport: inside JSON payload, show a name if DID matches a contact
- 80 0 fix swagger API docs http://localhost:3000/api-explorer/ (linked from main page)

    - and fill it
  - remove jwt.claimEncoded
  - change JWT & CONFIRMATION subject to subjectDid; issuer to issuerDid & type to VARCHAR(100)
- 80 0 gotta report errors to user (eg. unrecognized context URL or claim type in createWithClaimRecord result)
- 80 0 gotta report errors to user (eg. "encoded" instead of "jwtEncoded", no event found, repeated action claim submitted)
- 80 1 gotta report errors to user
  - eg. repeated or failed confirmations so should see mix of successes and errors
  - eg. remove hashHex column and see how parts succeed but there's still an error
  - ... and guard every API call in uport-demo with a response.ok check & error catch (and loader)
- 80 0 in SignClaim, set to confirmations & choose some, set to Join action, set to confirmations again and see that the list is not refreshed
- 80 0 usability: add a "waiting" spinner when remote method is called
- 70 0 bug: if there's already a response JWT & message then a new one might not show
- 70 0 retrieve dates in full ISO-format dates (eg for confirmations), not dates without timestamp
- 70 0 bug when a claim is duplicated (huh?)
- 70 0 remove duplicate decode in JWT service
- 70 0 add test for rejection of duplicate claim submissions
- 70 0 handle "access_denied" when person rejects claim on phone
- 70 0 usability: fade out the confirmation button when pushed
- 70 3 have someone audit use of uport.pushToken
- 70 1 tests: see above; duplicate JWT data; ACACs by different times; no claim in JWT
- 70 2 add Typescript
- 70 1 DID validation check adds seconds to the tests (see timeout(4001)) so find a faster validation
- 60 0 make record IDs into hashes not sequentially increasing numbers

- 30 0 try-catch around jwt.service resolveAuthenticator when not connected to internet
