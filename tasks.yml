- 2 use UUIDs instead of rowids (in case we want to make it impractical to download all claims, even though all the DIDs will be hidden)

- 2 publish txid of merkle-tree of the transactions (then automate merkle-tree)

- 0 and fix subjects (eg. Jun 29 claims by me for others)
- 1 allow read of all data in claims/confirmations issued by requester
- 1 in text search: show claim contents instead of DB records
- 1 in text search: remove any results without text after DIDs are hidden (because that means the matching data was a DID that the user shouldn't see)

- 0 remove the didVisibleToDids when listing possible confirmations
- 1 change name of app from "uport demo" (when logging in)

- 0 wrap all async functions (eg. services) in try-catch blocks
- 0 don't save in network table if subject is not * or valid DID (eg. avoid HIDDEN)
- 1 don't count any confirmations by original claimant in UI reporting
- 0 network: remove inserts and add explicit allowance for requester
- 0 is issuer used consistently from JWT (and is payload.iss usage accurate?)
- 0 rename issuer to issuerDid in confirmation table
- 0 retrieveTenureClaimsAndConfirmations & retrieveActionClaimsAndConfirmations should be OUTER JOIN?
- 0 document decision on whether original issuerDid adds to count (or should be removed from *_claim tables and built into logic)

  - 2 add search for claim on parcel of land
  - ?
- 1 fix deploy issues: npm ci & prune (in deploy.sh) and babel (above)
- 1 on ReportClaim there's a "*" next to hidden addresses, so explain it

- 1 report page: who has confirmations for an activity, test various data combinations (eg. action confirmed by self)
- 2 export to Neo4J
- 5 switch/add format to verifiable credentials?
- 5 uport: inside JSON payload, show a name if DID matches a contact
- 0 fix swagger API docs http://localhost:3000/api-explorer/ (linked from main page)
- 1 db
  - add action_claim.startDateCanonical
    - and fill it
  - add created date to each record
    - and fill it
  - remove jwt.claimEncoded
  - change JWT & CONFIRMATION subject to subjectDid; issuer to issuerDid & type to VARCHAR(100)
- 0 gotta report errors to user (eg. unrecognized context URL or claim type in createWithClaimRecord result)

- 1 gotta report errors to user
  - eg. repeated or failed confirmations so should see mix of successes and errors

- 1 tests: see above; duplicate JWT data; ACACs by different times; no claim in JWT
- 2 add Typescript
- 1 DID validation check adds seconds to the tests (see timeout(4001)) so find a faster validation
- 0 make record IDs into hashes not sequentially increasing numbers
- 0 write migration to remove claimEncoded column
